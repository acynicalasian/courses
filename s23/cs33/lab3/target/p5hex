/* Overall approach: */
/* Move current value of %rsp into some register, then jump around */
/* until we can move the middleman register value to %rdi? */
/* > at buf[40], jump to some mov %rsp, any register */
/* > at buf[48], store the string */
/* > at buf[56], jump to some mov %rsp, a different register */
/* > at buf[64], store 0 */
/* > at buf[72], jump
